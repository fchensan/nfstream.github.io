# NFStream Datasets

As part of NFStream Framework, we offer an open datasets collection that are collected using NFStream from several network 
environments. Our goal is to make network traffic measurement and analytics experiments simple, comparable, and 
reproducible. Datasets are built using NFStream default values. We enable both statistical and SPLT analysis. Generated 
CSVs file are anonymized using Blake2 algorithm with a randomly generated 64 bytes secret key. (**coming soon**)
